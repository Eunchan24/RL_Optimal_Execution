Implementation decisions/ Immediate Workflow:


-- Observation space will have a config object that will specify its shape -- Fernando
-- Action space will be an attribute of the environment declared during the run() -- Fernando
-- We will build an Analyzer class that receives the data feed in the same fashion as the agent and keeps track of execution
prices of the agent and benchmark algorithm. -- Florin
-- Don't worry about trainers for now.
-- Merge lob_env_old with base_env and delete the discarded parts. --Chris
-- Get the Datafeed up and running --Florin
-- Keep the Broker class as an attribute of the environment and have it manage the execution of orders (we will implement fancy execution aspects later) -- Chris
-- GUI/Render: PyQT library to monitor training graphs/ Tensorboard from RLLib to monitor training prices -- Florin
-- Provide Unittests to check for proper functionality of the implemented logic -- Chris
